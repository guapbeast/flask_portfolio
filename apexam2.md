I answered B for Question #1 (Any solution can be broken down into smaller and smaller parallel portions, making the improvement in efficiency theoretically limitless as long as there are enough processors available.), however, the correct answer was D: 
The efficiency of a solution that can be broken down into parallel portions is still limited by a sequential portion.

I answered B for Question #4 (The network would be considered fault-tolerant because it guarantees that no individual component will fail), however, the correct answer was A: The network is considered fault-tolerant because there are redundant paths between each pair of devices. B is the correct answer in this instance because the excess of paths between devices allows for a decreased chance of the network being taken down or rendered unusable.
