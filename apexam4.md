I answered B (Lossless compression of an image file will generally result in a file that is equal in size to the original file.) for Question #8, which was incorrect; the correct answer was C (Lossy compression of an image file generally provides a greater reduction in transmission time than lossless compression does.), because lossless compression decreases the sizes of files.

Correct Answer:  Public key encryption enables parties to initiate secure communications through an open medium, such as the Internet, in which there might be eavesdroppers.
