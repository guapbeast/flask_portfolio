I answered B (Lossless compression of an image file will generally result in a file that is equal in size to the original file.) for Question #8, which was incorrect; the correct answer was C (Lossy compression of an image file generally provides a greater reduction in transmission time than lossless compression does.), because lossless compression decreases the sizes of files.

Correct Answer:  Public key encryption enables parties to initiate secure communications through an open medium, such as the Internet, in which there might be eavesdroppers.

I answered C (Hannah writes a message to send to Isabel and hides the message under a rock behind the soccer field. Hannah gives Isabel the exact location of the rock so that only Isabel can find the message.) for question #46, which was incorrect; the correct answer was B (Finn and Gwen develop a system that maps each letter of the alphabet to a unique symbol using a secret key. Finn uses the key to write a message to Gwen where each letter is replaced with the corresponding symbol. Gwen uses the key to map each symbol back to the original letter.), because the system doesn't hide the data.
