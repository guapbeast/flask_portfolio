I answered A for Question #1 (How long the problem takes to run), however, the correct answer was B: How many programming statements the program contains. B is the correct answer because larger data sets are much more difficult to process in a shorter amount of time.




**Question #4:**

I answered B for Question #4 (The network would be considered fault-tolerant because it guarantees that no individual component will fail), however, the correct answer was A: The network is considered fault-tolerant because there are redundant paths between each pair of devices. B is the correct answer in this instance because the excess of paths between devices allows for a decreased chance of the network being taken down or rendered unusable.

**Question #23:**

I answered B for Question #23 (The Internet Protocol (IP) address of the user’s computer), which was incorrect; the correct answer was A (A group of cookies stored by the user’s Web browser), because IP addresses don't contain any information about a user.

**Question #24**

I answered B for Question #24 (Each packet contains an encrypted version of the data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing the key needed to decrypt the data), which was incorrect because each packet contains data that needs to be transmitted, alongside metadata that helps with its routing. The correct answer was A (Each packet contains data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing information used for routing the data).

**Question # 30**

I answered C for Question #30 (I and II), which was incorrect; the correct answer was A (I only) because digital certificates are only used to verify the ownership of encrypted keys used in secured communication. 

**Question #45**

I answered B for Question # 45 (In which political candidates are people interested?), which was incorrect; the correct answer was C (What is the cost of a certain electronics product?), because the costs of certain electronic products were the only data not present in the database.

**Question #46**

I answered A for Question # 46 (Open protocols allow devices to specify how data packets are to be routed on the Internet in advance.), which was incorrect; the correct answer was D (Open protocols provide a way to standardize data transmission between different devices.).
