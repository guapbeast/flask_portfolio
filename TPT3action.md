PII on project in CompSci Principles includes names and links to media.

I think that individuals should limit the PII that they expose to others in order to ensure their security. I personally don't expose too much PII on the internet.

_3. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication._

Good passwords include different varying types of characters (uppercase, lowercase, numerical, signs, emojis, etc.) which add another level of complexity to the password. One other step that is used in authentication is the use of codes sent to phones in order to verify a sign-in.
