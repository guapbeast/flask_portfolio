Harmful
Broken TV’s and injuries


Innovations can have effects that the creators did not intend. 
Microtransactions
“Free” games/apps
Cosmetics or pay to win
May harm society.








Come up with three of your own beneficial and corresponding harmful effects of computing
Beneficial:
Can automate processes in order to reach people’s interests more
Allows for better communication through further distances
Can be used for enjoyment (in moderation)
Harmful:
Can be addictive for those that use technology for enjoyment
Can be used to spread mass amounts of false information
Often puts personal information in danger of compromise
Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in high school?
I believe that dopamine issues are a real thing. At a certain point, they were in fact impacting my personal study and success in high school due to the addictiveness of video games and other things that should be used in moderation like YouTube. Gradually, as one’s brain gets awarded through things like video games, they desire that same feeling more. This can thus make it easier to get addicted to things that the internet offers, effectively affecting personal study and success, whether in high school or in general.






5.2: Digital Divide
The digital divide refers to differing access to computing devices and the internet, based on socioeconomic, geography, or demographic characteristics.
The digital divide can affect groups and individuals.
Digital divide raises questions of equity, access, and influence.
Digital divide affected by people

In some countries
Computers are not common in rural areas
The internet is used to protect and advocate the government
High level of surveillance on the internet to protect the government









How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
People are empowered through the digital world due to the access of all of the world’s information being readily available upon a few keystrokes. If somebody is truly dedicated to learning a craft, they can learn through the internet. Additionally, one can empower themself in a digital world by being part of some sort of team in a virtual setting, which can make them feel included in a digital setting.
How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
Somebody that is empowered is able to reach out to those that do not share the same feelings of empowerment and do whatever is needed to support them. Sometimes this can be in the form of advice, a nice gesture, or a compliment. At DNHS, I am able to empower somebody that does not feel empowered by reaching out to them if they need help with anything. For example, I am on the track and field team, meaning that I am able to reach out to others that may need instruction and offer my advice or encourage them. Strictly in a digital setting, social media users that feel empowered can help those that do not feel empowered by sticking up for them. 
Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? 
Paper/red tape is not blocking digital empowerment. This is because most platforms that empower users give them a certain amount of freedom that they are entitled to as internet users. A good example is the social media app Twitter, which has strict guidelines to protect users, but also gives ways to empower the same users to the extent that many regularly rely on Twitter as a source of money. Additionally, these guidelines may be strict, but there will always be workarounds. In the case of Del Norte, there are the same barriers. Websites that are inappropriate or could be safety hazards in a school setting are blocked by the district. However, there are also workarounds to this, like using a virtual private network in order to browse the internet regardless of restrictions. These barriers could also exist in places like certain workplaces. There may be less workarounds, but there are no exhaustive limitations that make users feel like they are not empowered when they have access to the digital world.





















5.3 Computing Bias
Ex: Netflix
Explicit data: thumbs up/thumbs down, name, address, etc
Implicit data: When you watch, what show you binge(d), style of show frequently selected
Bias in this example: Netflix exclusives are featured ahead of most - they want more subscriptions
Main idea: Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation.
Ex: Hypothetical loan company - creating software to assist loan officers. Software finds trends in successful loans
Reject those who don’t fit their trends: age, gender, race/ethnicity
Main idea; Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases.

Main idea: Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development
All software can be biased (unintentional/intentional):
Casual vs sweaty
YouTube Kids
Facebook vs Instagram vs Snapchat/TikTok
WeChat/KakaoTalk
Google Home/Amazon Echo
Questions to ask about bias:
Enhancing or intentionally excluding? 
Intentionally harmful/hateful?
Receiving feedback from a wide variety of people?
5.4 Crowdsourcing
Public data sets
Kaggle
Courses in visualizations, TensorFlow, AI, machine learning, and more
Competitions - cash prizes, swag, props
Notebooks - code, data, notes
Google public datasets
Free for the 1st terabyte
All-in-one package that uses BigQuery - Library and toolset that for SQL
Data.gov
US government data
Agriculture, energy, water, health
Your local government
Keeps them accountable
Help find solutions and trends in your area
Main idea: widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results.
Distributed computing
Donate spare computing power to help calculations
Folding@Home - Stanford University
Protein folding
BOINC - University of California, Berkeley
A variety of projects: mathematics, astrophysics, climate, Minecraft@Home
Main Ideas:
Science has been affected by using distributed and “citizen science” to solve scientific problems.
Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices.
Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing.
Innovations made possible with crowdsourcing
Spotify
Collaborative playlists
Algorithm
Metadata write-in
Crowdfunding
Kickstarter
IndieGoGo
Blockchain
Cryptocurrency
Other tokens - concert tickets
Main Ideas:
Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the Internet.
Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding.








5.5: Legal and Ethical Concerns
Intellectual Property: (IP)

A work or invention that is the result of creativity to which one has rights.

Because of digital devices, the sharing and ownership of IP’s has raised concerns about whether someone can access someone else’s creations

Copyright protects an IP; when you create anything, you automatically own an all rights reserved copyright to whatever was created

Copyright protects IP and keeps anyone from using it unless given expressed permission

When someone takes material created by someone else and presents it as their own, it’s considered plagiarism and might have legal consequences.

Creative Commons provides free licenses to tell people how to use one’s creations.


5.6: Legal and Ethical Concerns

Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Information specific to an individual
Examples include: 
Social Security Number
Age 
Race
Phone Number
Date of Birth
Email Address
Mailing Address
Medical Information
Credit Card information
Personally Identifiable Information (PII): Can be used by people to steal identity
Although PII can be used to enhance a user’s online experience, it can also be exploited without protections and privacy.
Information placed online is hard to delete.
