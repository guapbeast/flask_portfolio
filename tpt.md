Come up with three of your own beneficial and corresponding harmful effects of computing
Beneficial:

Harmful:

Can be used to spread mass amounts of false information
Often puts personal information in danger of compromise
Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in high school?
I believe that dopamine issues are a real thing. At a certain point, they were in fact impacting my personal study and success in high school due to the addictiveness of video games and other things that should be used in moderation like YouTube. Gradually, as one’s brain gets awarded through things like video games, they desire that same feeling more. This can thus make it easier to get addicted to things that the internet offers, effectively affecting personal study and success, whether in high school or in general.






5.2: Digital Divide
The digital divide refers to differing access to computing devices and the internet, based on socioeconomic, geography, or demographic characteristics.
The digital divide can affect groups and individuals.
Digital divide raises questions of equity, access, and influence.

How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
People are empowered through the digital world due to the access of all of the world’s information being readily available upon a few keystrokes. If somebody is truly dedicated to learning a craft, they can learn through the internet. Additionally, one can empower themself in a digital world by being part of some sort of team in a virtual setting, which can make them feel included in a digital setting.
How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
Somebody that is empowered is able to reach out to those that do not share the same feelings of empowerment and do whatever is needed to support them. Sometimes this can be in the form of advice, a nice gesture, or a compliment. At DNHS, I am able to empower somebody that does not feel empowered by reaching out to them if they need help with anything. For example, I am on the track and field team, meaning that I am able to reach out to others that may need instruction and offer my advice or encourage them. Strictly in a digital setting, social media users that feel empowered can help those that do not feel empowered by sticking up for them. 
Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? 
Paper/red tape is not blocking digital empowerment. This is because most platforms that empower users give them a certain amount of freedom that they are entitled to as internet users. A good example is the social media app Twitter, which has strict guidelines to protect users, but also gives ways to empower the same users to the extent that many regularly rely on Twitter as a source of money. Additionally, these guidelines may be strict, but there will always be workarounds. In the case of Del Norte, there are the same barriers. Websites that are inappropriate or could be safety hazards in a school setting are blocked by the district. However, there are also workarounds to this, like using a virtual private network in order to browse the internet regardless of restrictions. These barriers could also exist in places like certain workplaces. There may be less workarounds, but there are no exhaustive limitations that make users feel like they are not empowered when they have access to the digital world.
