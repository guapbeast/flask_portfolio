**5.3 Computing Bias**

Ex: Netflix
Explicit data: thumbs up/thumbs down, name, address, etc
Implicit data: When you watch, what show you binge(d), style of show frequently selected
Bias in this example: Netflix exclusives are featured ahead of most - they want more subscriptions
Main idea: Computing innovations can reflect existing human biases because of biases written into the algorithms or biases in the data used by the innovation.
Ex: Hypothetical loan company - creating software to assist loan officers. Software finds trends in successful loans
Reject those who don’t fit their trends: age, gender, race/ethnicity
Main idea; Programmers should take action to reduce bias in algorithms used for computing innovations as a way of combating existing human biases.

Main idea: Biases can be embedded at all levels of software development
All software can be biased (unintentional/intentional):
Casual vs sweaty
YouTube Kids
Facebook vs Instagram vs Snapchat/TikTok
WeChat/KakaoTalk
Google Home/Amazon Echo
Questions to ask about bias:
Enhancing or intentionally excluding? 
Intentionally harmful/hateful?
Receiving feedback from a wide variety of people?


**5.4 Crowdsourcing**


Public data sets
Kaggle
Courses in visualizations, TensorFlow, AI, machine learning, and more
Competitions - cash prizes, swag, props
Notebooks - code, data, notes
Google public datasets
Free for the 1st terabyte
All-in-one package that uses BigQuery - Library and toolset that for SQL
Data.gov
US government data
Agriculture, energy, water, health
Your local government
Keeps them accountable
Help find solutions and trends in your area
Main idea: widespread access to information and public data facilitates the identification of problems, development of solutions, and dissemination of results.
Distributed computing
Donate spare computing power to help calculations
Folding@Home - Stanford University
Protein folding
BOINC - University of California, Berkeley
A variety of projects: mathematics, astrophysics, climate, Minecraft@Home
Main Ideas:
Science has been affected by using distributed and “citizen science” to solve scientific problems.
Citizen science is scientific research conducted in whole or part by distributed individuals, many of whom may not be scientists, who contribute relevant data to research using their own computing devices.
Human capabilities can be enhanced by collaboration via computing.
Innovations made possible with crowdsourcing
Spotify
Collaborative playlists
Algorithm
Metadata write-in
Crowdfunding
Kickstarter
IndieGoGo
Blockchain
Cryptocurrency
Other tokens - concert tickets
Main Ideas:
Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining input or information from a large number of people via the Internet.
Crowdsourcing offers new models for collaboration, such as connecting businesses or social causes with funding.
