5.1: Beneficial and Harmful Effects 5.1 Beneficial and Harmful Effects (of computing innovations)

Video 1 How can the effects of computing innovations be beneficial and harmful?

Essential Knowledge: People create computing innovations The way people complete tasks often changes to incorporate new computing innovations Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications,and the arts

Wii vs iPhone -Wii came out 7 months before the iPhone Wii controller and iPhone have accelerometers in them (detects acceleration, motion, and orientation) Accelerometers: part of automobile industry; chip that detects acceleration If you’re going really fast and come to a halt, airbag will deploy; Used for airbag deployment and lateral movement detection Quadcopter “brain”detects if it is going to lay flat or not Evolution from auto industry of accelerometers into Wii, iPhones, drones, etc

Multirotor/Drone: Benefit - deliveries, finding lost people, aerial photography Harmful - flying in unregulated zones is illegal and dangerous, privacy concerns Wii controller Benefit - gets people active playing video games Harmful - broken TV’s and injuries Not every effect of a computing innovation is anticipated in advance; who would’ve known that the Wii would result in injuries. A single effect can be viewed as both beneficial and harmful by different people or even by the same person; for example, with the Wii, some people view it as being potentially dangerous, and some people play it simply because it is fun and provides a way to be active.

3D Printers Open-source software; the software inside is free and widely used and are able to be adjusted as you see fit Present in schools and homes; new classes developed for 3D printing

3D printers can make: organs/prosthetics Houses Shoes Jewelry People create computer innovations. Advances in computing have generated and increased creativity in other fields, such as medicine, engineering, communications, and the arts.

How can a computing innovation have an impact beyond its intended purpose?

Essential knowledge: Computing innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses It is not possible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be sued Rapid sharing of a program or running a program with a large number of users can result in significant impacts beyond the intended purpose or control of the programmer

The internet - originally designed for scientists Meant to share info quickly and securely without having to mail things back and forth Provides easy way to collaborate and communicate

Now, people spend more time on the internet than sleeping Use of the internet includes: social media, netflix, youtube, etc. We are on it all the time

When using internet, we get a dopamine feedback loop when we get likes, comments, or watching videos by our favorite youtubers; we are always seeking out for a little more dopamine before bed We are often on the internet, browsing on our phones mindlessly Leads to sleep deprivation, depression, anxiety, impulsivity When we are stripped from our internet connectivity, and our phones get taken away, that is why we often get very emotional Computing Innovations can be used in ways that their creators had not originally intended. Responsible programmers try to consider the unintended ways their computing innovations can be used and the potential beneficial and harmful effects of these new uses

Microtransactions Typically happen in free games/apps Little payments for you to get: Cosmetics Paywall to functionality Pay-to-win (powerups in games) A lot of times, you pay into a system’s currency Gold, vbucks, coins, chips, SBUX (starbucks) SBUX - your money is converted into SBUX, and you can only spend that money at starbucks Sometimes, this causes a casino effect because you don’t realize how much money you are spending, which results in you overpaying for something Loot boxes - you receive a box where you open and get a bunch of cosmetics and skins; considered gambling because it has an addictive nature Some of the ways computing innovations can be used may have a harmful impact on society, the economy, or culture. It is not possible for a programmer to consider all the ways a computing innovation can be used. Rapid sharing of a program or running a program with a large number of users can result in significant impacts beyond the intended purpsoe or control of the programmer

5.2 Notes (

Digital divide is differing access to computing devices and the internet. Socioeconomic groups How much money owned and made by household Geographic Characteristics High vs low wages Actions of individuals, governments, and organizations affect digital divides.
