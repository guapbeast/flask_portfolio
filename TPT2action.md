**5.3 Computing Bias**

_1. Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? If yes or no, justify you conclusion._

The owner of the computer does not think that the webcamp's function was intentional because the owner was open to reasosn on why the webcam was malfunctioning.

_2. How do you think this happened?_

I think that when the technology was being designed, perspectives and ideas of all people weren't taken into account, leading to inherent bias in the technology.

_3. Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?_

Yes, it is harmful, because individuals don't get full access to the technology that they paid for based on their physical attributes. I don't think that the technology was meant to be harmful or exclude people, and rather, was unintentional.


_4. Should it be corrected?_

Yes, the error should be corrected to ensure an equally good experience for all customers of the product.

_5. What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?_

In order to produce a better outcome, measures need to be taken to include all people in the functionality of a technological development. This can be done through having a diverse array of people in the development of a technology, which would result in the diverse perspectives and ideas of all individuals involved to ensure a better representation of an equal experience.




**5.4 Crowdsourcing** 

_1. CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?_

A possible crowdsource idea that could be implemented in our environment is a survey, or an interest form, that each of the students in Computer Science could provide to each of their classes getting information from every student in every one of their classes, helping spread information about Computer Science and providing surveys for the class to take.

_2. What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?_

Our project could be better with Del Norte crowdsourcing because it could help with the obtaining of data and provision of resources that could enhance the website through extra informational data.
