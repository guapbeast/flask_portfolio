**5.3**

Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas...
Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
How do you think this happened?
Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
Should it be corrected?
What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?





**5.4 Crowdsourcing** 

* **CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?**

A possible crowdsource idea that could be implemented in our environment is a survey, or an interest form, that each of the students in Computer Science could provide to each of their classes getting information from every student in every one of their classes, helping spread information about Computer Science and providing surveys for the class to take.

* **What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?**

Our project could be better with Del Norte crowdsourcing because it could help with the obtaining of data and provision of resources that could enhance the website through extra informational data.
