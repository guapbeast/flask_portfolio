* **CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?**

A possible crowdsource idea that could be implemented in our environment is a survey, or an interest form, that each of the students in Computer Science could provide to each of their classes getting information from every student in every one of their classes, helping spread information about Computer Science and providing surveys for the class to take.

* **What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?**

Our project could be better with Del Norte crowdsourcing because it could help with the obtaining of data and provision of resources that could enhance the website through extra informational data.
