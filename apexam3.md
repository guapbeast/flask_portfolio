I answered B for Question #3 (I and II), however, the correct answer was B: II only. B is the correct answer in this instance because the algorithm I does not work in the given situation.


**Question #6:**

Question # 6 was a multiple answer choice problem and I chose answers A and C, which were incorrect; the correct answers were A and D because answer C doesn't display the number 20.

**Question #8**

I answered B (Step 1:
Assign each student a unique integer from 1 to 30. Step 2: Generate a random integer n from 1 to 30. Step 3: Select the student who is currently assigned integer n and display the student’s name. Step 4: Generate a new random integer n from 1 to 30. Step 5: Select the student who is currently assigned integer n and display the student’s name.) for Question #8, which was incorrect; the correct answer was D, since B contains the possibility of having multiple students selected twice.

**Question #43**

I answered C (The most expensive item purchased on a given date can be determined by searching the data for all items purchased on the given date and then sorting the matching items by item price) for Question #43, which was incorrect; the correct answer was D (The total number of items purchased on a given date can be determined by searching the data for all transactions that occurred on the given date and then adding the number of items purchased for each matching transaction), because the most expensive item cannot be determined by the use of the data collected.
