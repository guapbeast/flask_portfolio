I answered B for Question #3 (I and II), however, the correct answer was B: II only. B is the correct answer in this instance because the algorithm I does not work in the given situation.


**Question #6:**

Question # 6 was a multiple answer choice problem and I chose answers A and C, which were incorrect; the correct answers were A and D because answer C doesn't display the number 20.

**Question #8**

I answered B (Step 1:
Assign each student a unique integer from 1 to 30. Step 2: Generate a random integer n from 1 to 30. Step 3: Select the student who is currently assigned integer n and display the student’s name. Step 4: Generate a new random integer n from 1 to 30. Step 5: Select the student who is currently assigned integer n and display the student’s name.) for Question #8, which was incorrect; the correct answer was D, since B contains the possibility of having multiple students selected twice.

**Question #10**

I answered C (string) for Question #43, which was incorrect; the correct answer was A (Boolean), because the use of a boolean is more appropriate in this case.


**Question #17**

I answered B for question # 17, however the correct answer was C and D, because the procedure listed for B returns the correct answer, not the incorrect answer.


**Question # 18**

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-03 at 1 39 13 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86858869/166562127-35ba24a3-a836-40ed-9417-86c147e5404b.png">


I answered B for question # 18, which was incorrect; the correc answer was C, because the procedure from be will never generate a positive value.

**Question # 24**

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-03 at 1 55 27 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86858869/166564521-b60e832c-781a-42f3-ba68-167237b76a8d.png">

I answered A for question # 24 (Check if the time is outside of business hours. If it is, check if the gate sensor is activated. If it is, check if the gate is closed. If it is, turn on the motor.), which was incorrect; the correct answer was D (Check if the time is during business hours. If it is, check if the gate sensor is activated. If it is, check if the gate is open. If it is not, turn on the motor.) because A allows for the motor to activate outside of the hours of business.

**Question # 32**

I answered C for question # 32 (II and III only), which was incorrect; the correct answer was B(II only), because the expression 12 + 3 would not create an overflow error.


**Question # 36**

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-03 at 2 03 20 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86858869/166565870-bc80256e-baf3-4b69-bd6a-4b95589a1c8c.png">

I answered C and D (7 and 6) for question #36, which was incorrect; the correct answer was B and C ()8 and 6 because the algorithm displays correctly when 7 is inputted.


**Question #38**

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-03 at 2 06 16 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86858869/166566250-829dc219-9157-40c6-b7d1-bf76fdca97ef.png">

I answered D (Individuals will be legally prevented from using excerpts from the e-book in another published work.)for question #38, which was incorrect; the correct answer was B (Individuals can freely distribute or use the contents of the e-book without needing to obtain additional permissions from the author.), because people won't be prevented from using the texts.


**Question #46**

![Screen Shot 2022-05-03 at 2 08 19 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86858869/166566612-1939af36-0b8e-4457-8cd9-b4a451a5b244.png)

I answered C (Hannah writes a message to send to Isabel and hides the message under a rock behind the soccer field. Hannah gives Isabel the exact location of the rock so that only Isabel can find the message.) for question #46, which was incorrect; the correct answer was B (Finn and Gwen develop a system that maps each letter of the alphabet to a unique symbol using a secret key. Finn uses the key to write a message to Gwen where each letter is replaced with the corresponding symbol. Gwen uses the key to map each symbol back to the original letter.), because the system doesn't hide the data.
