I answered B for Question #3 (I and II), however, the correct answer was B: II only. B is the correct answer in this instance because the algorithm I does not work in the given situation.


**Question #6:**

Question # 6 was a multiple answer choice problem and I chose answers A and C, which were incorrect; the correct answers were A and D because answer C doesn't display the number 20.

**Question #8**

I answered B (Step 1:
Assign each student a unique integer from 1 to 30. Step 2: Generate a random integer n from 1 to 30. Step 3: Select the student who is currently assigned integer n and display the student’s name. Step 4: Generate a new random integer n from 1 to 30. Step 5: Select the student who is currently assigned integer n and display the student’s name.) for Question #8, which was incorrect; the correct answer was D, since B contains the possibility of having multiple students selected twice.

**Question #10**

I answered C (string) for Question #43, which was incorrect; the correct answer was A (Boolean), because the use of a boolean is more appropriate in this case.


**Question #17**

I answered B for question # 17, however the correct answer was C and D, because the procedure listed for B returns the correct answer, not the incorrect answer.
