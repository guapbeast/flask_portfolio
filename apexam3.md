I answered B for Question #3 (I and II), however, the correct answer was B: II only. B is the correct answer in this instance because the algorithm I does not work in the given situation.


**Question #6:**

Question # 6 was a multiple answer choice problem and I chose answers A and C, which were incorrect; the correct answers were A and D because answer C doesn't display the number 20.

I answered B (Step 1:
Assign each student a unique integer from 1 to 30. Step 2: Generate a random integer n from 1 to 30. Step 3: Select the student who is currently assigned integer n and display the student’s name. Step 4: Generate a new random integer n from 1 to 30. Step 5: Select the student who is currently assigned integer n and display the student’s name.) for Question #8, which was incorrect; the correct answer was D, since B contains the possibility of having multiple students selected twice.

**Question #10**

I answered C (string) for Question #43, which was incorrect; the correct answer was A (Boolean), because the use of a boolean is more appropriate in this case.


**Question #17**

I answered B for question # 17, however the correct answer was C and D, because the procedure listed for B returns the correct answer, not the incorrect answer.


**Question # 18**

<img width="1440" alt="Screen Shot 2022-05-03 at 1 39 13 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86858869/166562127-35ba24a3-a836-40ed-9417-86c147e5404b.png">


I answered B for question # 18, which was incorrect; the correc answer was C, because the procedure from be will never generate a positive value.

**Question # 24**

I answered A for question # 24 (Check if the time is outside of business hours. If it is, check if the gate sensor is activated. If it is, check if the gate is closed. If it is, turn on the motor.), which was incorrect; the correct answer was D (Check if the time is during business hours. If it is, check if the gate sensor is activated. If it is, check if the gate is open. If it is not, turn on the motor.) because A allows for the motor to activate outside of the hours of business.
