**5.5: Legal and Ethical Concerns**

Intellectual Property: (IP)

A work or invention that is the result of creativity to which one has rights.

Because of digital devices, the sharing and ownership of IP’s has raised concerns about whether someone can access someone else’s creations

Copyright protects an IP; when you create anything, you automatically own an all rights reserved copyright to whatever was created

Copyright protects IP and keeps anyone from using it unless given expressed permission

When someone takes material created by someone else and presents it as their own, it’s considered plagiarism and might have legal consequences.

Creative Commons provides free licenses to tell people how to use one’s creations.
